# Simple Pagination Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of pagination in a web application. It includes a multi-page setup where each page represents a portion of a larger dataset or content, divided across multiple pages for better readability and easier navigation. The content on each page is static, represented by placeholder text, and the navigation is facilitated through hardcoded links to simulate pagination.

## Features

- Basic pagination system with navigation links:
  - First page
  - Previous page
  - Next page
  - Last page
  - Direct page number links
  - Ellipses (...) to indicate more pages

## Project Structure

The project is structured with HTML files representing each page, accompanied by a common CSS file for styling. Here's what the file structure looks like:
